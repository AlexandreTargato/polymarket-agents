# Polymarket Trading Agent Strategy

## Overview

An automated research system that identifies potential trading opportunities on Polymarket by comparing AI-powered deep research findings against current market pricing. The system runs daily and delivers a comprehensive email report at 9:00 AM with actionable insights.

## Core Principle

**Information Asymmetry Exploitation**: Prediction markets can misprice outcomes when traders lack access to comprehensive research. By systematically researching questions that require deep analysis, we can identify when markets undervalue or overvalue certain outcomes.

## Stage 1: Market Fetching

### Objective

Retrieve all currently active markets from Polymarket API.

### Implementation

- Connect to Polymarket API
- Fetch markets with active trading
- Retrieve current odds, volume, liquidity, resolution date
- Typical output: 500-1000 active markets

---

## Stage 2: Multi-Stage Filtering

### Objective

Narrow down to 15-25 high-potential markets worth researching.

### Filter Criteria (Applied Sequentially)

#### **Filter 1: Volume & Liquidity**

- **Minimum Volume**: $10,000+ total volume
- **Minimum Liquidity**: $5,000+ available liquidity
- **Rationale**: Ensures you can actually enter/exit positions without major slippage

#### **Filter 2: Time Horizon**

- **Sweet Spot**: Resolves in 7-30 days
- **Avoid**: <7 days (too little time to act) or >60 days (too much uncertainty)
- **Rationale**: Optimal window for research edge vs. market efficiency

#### **Filter 3: Category Selection**

- **Focus Categories**: Politics, Business, Technology, Regulatory
- **Exclude**: Sports, Crypto prices, Subjective outcomes
- **Rationale**: Start with domains where research provides clear edge

#### **Filter 4: Question Type**

- **Prefer**: Binary outcomes, factual resolutions, objective criteria
- **Exclude**:
  - Multiple choice with >4 options (complex probability distribution)
  - Subjective resolution criteria
  - Questions requiring insider knowledge
  - Entertainment/celebrity questions

#### **Filter 5: Market Maturity**

- **Prefer**: Markets open for 24-72 hours
- **Avoid**: Brand new (<12 hours) or stale (>2 weeks old)
- **Rationale**: New markets may not have found equilibrium; old markets likely efficient

### Expected Output

15-25 filtered markets ready for research

---

## Stage 3: Tier 1 Research (Fast Context)

### Objective

Quickly gather basic context for each filtered market to identify which deserve deep research.

### Process (Per Market - 60-90 seconds each)

1. **Web Search Query Formation**

   - Extract key entities from question
   - Form 2-3 targeted search queries
   - Example: "Will SpaceX launch Starship before Q1 2025?"
     - Query 1: "SpaceX Starship launch schedule 2024"
     - Query 2: "Starship test timeline updates"

2. **Information Gathering**

   - Run web searches (last 7 days prioritized)
   - Scan top 5-10 results per query
   - Focus on: News articles, official announcements, expert analysis

3. **Quick Analysis (Fast LLM)**

   - Use lightweight model (GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku)
   - Prompt: "Based on these sources, what's the current status? Any recent developments?"
   - Generate 2-3 sentence summary

4. **Preliminary Assessment**
   - Does research suggest market might be mispriced?
   - Is there new information not yet priced in?
   - Are there quality sources available?

### Decision Point

**Proceed to Tier 2 if:**

- Recent material developments found
- Quality sources available
- Preliminary analysis suggests >10% potential edge
- Information appears underweighted by market

**Expected Output**: 5-8 markets flagged for deep research

---

## Stage 4: Tier 2 Research (Deep Analysis)

### Objective

Comprehensive research to build high-confidence probability estimate.

### Process (Per Market - 5-10 minutes each)

#### **4.1 Comprehensive Information Gathering**

**Source Diversity**

- News aggregation (Google News, specialized outlets)
- Official sources (company announcements, government sites)
- Expert analysis (industry blogs, analyst reports)
- Social signals (relevant Twitter accounts, Reddit discussions)
- Historical data (precedents, base rates)

**Search Strategy**

- 5-8 targeted queries per question
- Include negative searches ("Why X won't happen")
- Time-boxed searches (last 24h, last 7d, last 30d)
- Non-English sources when relevant

#### **4.2 Deep Analysis (Premium LLM)**

Use Claude Opus, GPT-4, or dedicated Deep Research tool:

**Analysis Framework**

```
1. Current State Assessment
   - What is the current situation?
   - What are the key facts?

2. Historical Context
   - What are relevant precedents?
   - What is the base rate for this type of event?

3. Key Variables
   - What factors determine the outcome?
   - What has changed recently?
   - What could change before resolution?

4. Probability Estimation
   - Synthesize all information
   - Weight by source credibility
   - Consider both sides
   - Provide confidence interval

5. Contrarian Analysis
   - Why might I be wrong?
   - What is the market seeing that I'm not?
   - What would change my estimate?
```

#### **4.3 Source Quality Assessment**

- Rate each source (1-5 stars)
- Note conflicts of interest
- Verify publication dates
- Cross-reference claims

#### **4.4 Generate Structured Output**

```json
{
  "market_id": "xxx",
  "question": "...",
  "model_estimate": {
    "yes_probability": 0.75,
    "confidence_interval": [0.68, 0.82],
    "confidence_level": "medium-high"
  },
  "key_findings": [
    "Finding 1 with source",
    "Finding 2 with source",
    "Finding 3 with source"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Comprehensive explanation...",
  "base_rate": "Historical data shows...",
  "recent_developments": "In the last 48 hours...",
  "risks_to_thesis": ["Risk 1", "Risk 2"],
  "information_quality": "high/medium/low",
  "sources": [{ "url": "...", "title": "...", "credibility": 4, "date": "..." }]
}
```

---

## Stage 5: Opportunity Analysis & Scoring

### Objective

Compare model estimates to market prices and identify genuine opportunities.

### Calculation Framework

#### **5.1 Edge Calculation**

```
Edge = |Model_Probability - Market_Probability|

Example:
Model says YES: 75%
Market prices YES: 58%
Edge = 17 percentage points
```

#### **5.2 Confidence Scoring**

**Factors (0-1 scale each):**

- **Source Quality**: Average credibility of sources
- **Information Recency**: How recent is key information
- **Consensus Level**: Do sources agree?
- **Base Rate Alignment**: Does estimate match historical patterns?
- **Reasoning Clarity**: How clear is the logical path?

```
Confidence Score = Average of factors
```

#### **5.3 Opportunity Score**

```
Opportunity Score = Edge × Confidence Score × Liquidity Factor

Where Liquidity Factor = min(1.0, market_liquidity / $10,000)
```

#### **5.4 Risk Assessment**

**Red Flags (Reduce Score):**

- Market has recent large trades (possible insider info)
- Low source diversity (only 1-2 sources)
- High uncertainty in key variables
- Resolves very soon (<7 days)
- Low model confidence
- Conflicting expert opinions

**Green Flags (Increase Score):**

- New public information not yet reflected
- Clear factual basis for estimate
- High quality, diverse sources
- Multiple convergent lines of evidence
- Market appears to use outdated information
